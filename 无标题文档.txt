A clean Arial font ensures readability and professional presentation throughout the pages. Images related to the Celtics and NBA basketball were integrated using rounded corners and subtle shadows for enhanced visual appeal.

Additionally, a customized footer offers direct, clickable contact information via both email (mailto) and telephone (tel) protocols, improving accessibility and user experience.

      Founded in 1946, the Boston Celtics are recognized for their extraordinary NBA success. From 1957 to 1969, they secured an astonishing 11 championships in 13 seasons under legendary coach Red Auerbach and iconic player Bill Russell. The 1980s saw a revival with Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, bringing three more championships. After a drought, the Celtics won their 17th title in 2008 led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, marking a significant milestone for the franchise.
